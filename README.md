# STATIC_FEA_GUI

**STATIC_FEA_GUI** is a graphical tool designed to perform **static structural analysis** on 3D models using the **Finite Element Method (FEM)**. It works with `.STEP` files and allows users to carry out the full analysis workflow ‚Äî from mesh generation to post-processing ‚Äî through a simplified interface. The computations are fully handled in **Python** using only open-source libraries, and the solution process leverages **parallel computing** to reduce processing times.

This application is particularly suitable for engineering students, researchers, or developers interested in learning or performing basic FEM simulations without relying on commercial tools.

## üñ•Ô∏è About the Interface

This is the **first public release** of the software, and the interface is intentionally kept **minimalistic and essential** to focus on core functionality. Despite its simplicity, it provides all the necessary tools to execute a complete static FEM analysis on isotropic materials.

The software is structured into **multiple steps**, each corresponding to a specific phase of the analysis:

1. **Import geometry**
2. **Generate mesh**
3. **Apply boundary conditions**
4. **Run the solver**
5. **Post-process results**

Each step includes a **yellow instruction box** explaining the available commands and how to interact with the current panel. This makes it easy to follow the workflow, even for users new to the tool.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

This repository includes:
- The **Python source scripts** used to build the software.
- The **PyInstaller build files** used to generate the standalone executable.
- The actual **Windows executable** (`.exe`), available in the [Releases](https://github.com/Fraticss/STATIC_FEA_GUI/releases) section.

---

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Download the `.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Fraticss/STATIC_FEA_GUI/releases) section.
2. Place your `.STEP` file in the `Input` folder created by the software.
3. Follow the on-screen steps, reading the instructions at each phase.
4. View your results in the final post-processing step.
